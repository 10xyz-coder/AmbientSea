Ambient Sea has a basic math library, which supports most math functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, indices, and grouping

Basic Usage
----------------

To perform a basic operation, use that operations symbol between the 2 numbers you want to use.

For example:

>>> 24 + 19
(43)
>>> 10 - 4
(6)
>>> 6 * 3
(18)
>>> 4 / 8
(0.5)


To perform indices, use the Caret symbol (``^``)

For example:

>>> 3 ^ 2
(9)
>>> 6 ^ 4
(1296)



Grouping
----------------

When using maths, Ambient Sea will follow the order of operations. In order to change that, you can use grouping symbols ``()``

For example:

>>> 3 * 4 + 6
(18)
>>> 3 * (4 + 6)
(30)
